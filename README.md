> [!NOTE]  
> The 25.04 release dropped a lot of metrics from the default Netdata plugins and migrated to custom python script to collect those metrics. This resulted in a loss of a lot of metrics and incompatibility of the dashboards. Dashboard updates will follow eventually.

> [!WARNING]
> Going forward from exporter configuration version 2.1, you must also use the Netdata configuration included in the repository to restore the pre‑25.04 metrics. Instructions are provided below.

# About The Project

The goal was to get the metrics from the TrueNAS reporting tap inside my normal monitoring stack which consists of prometheus and grafana. In earlier versions of TrueNAS this was possible by utilising the `collectd` graphite push service to push the metrics to a `graphite_exporter` instance which then converts the metrics to prometheus metrics based on the provided mapping file. In TrueNAS scale 23.10 the reporting system was changed to `netdata` and was missing the export feature all along. In `23.10.1` the export mechanism was added back in still lacking the ability to directly export the metrics to promeheus but still in the graphite form. But the metrics format changed due to the tool change.

The goal of this small repository is to provide you with a new `graphite_mapping.conf` which is suitable to be used with the new metrics exposed by TrueNAS. This mapping file is in active development and may change regularly in the near future. Besides the raw mapping file a based grafana dashboard nad a quick summary of the required settings in TrueNAS are also included.

### Built With

* [graphite_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/graphite_exporter)
* [grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
* [TrueNAS Scale 24.10](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

No changes are planned on my end right now.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Supporterino/truenas-graphite-to-prometheus/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- Supported versions -->
## Supported Versions
Those are the supported and tested versions of TrueNAS in combination with this exporter. Feel free to create a PR with a tested flag if you use a version not mentioned here.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### TrueNAS Scale

TrueNAS SCALE can export reporting data using the Graphite protocol (used by Netdata, Prometheus/Grafana pipelines, etc.). Below is a clear, copyable guide to creating or editing a reporter for Prometheus (or other Graphite-compatible targets), plus an important Netdata configuration note and example commands.

Creating or editing a reporter in TrueNAS SCALE

1. Go to the `Reporting` tab and click the `Exporters` button on the top right.
2. Click `Add` to create a new reporter or click the `Edit` pencil icon next to the reporter you wish to use.

Ensure the following fields are adjusted depending on your target app or chart, as outlined in the [TrueNAS instructions](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaleuireference/reportingscreensscale/).

* The prefix for the graphite metrics need to be set to `truenas` for the mapping file to work
* The hostname field should be choosen according to your needs it will later populate the `instance` label of your metrics
* The `update every` field should match your scrape time
* For `Send Names Instead Of Ids`, leave it blank and it will default to `true` (otherwise it may error out when trying to create the exporter).
* Destination IP and Port: point these to the host and port where your `graphite_exporter` (or another Graphite-compatible receiver) is listening.

> [!Note]
> You must copy the provided `netdata.conf` from this repository to your TrueNAS host at `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` so Netdata uses the configuration we provide.

Example commands (run on the TrueNAS host or with appropriate privileges):
```bash
# Adjust the source path below to where you cloned/downloaded the repo
sudo cp /path/to/repo/netdata.conf /etc/netdata/netdata.conf
sudo chown root:root /etc/netdata/netdata.conf
# Restart Netdata to pick up the new config (service name may vary)
sudo systemctl restart netdata
```

> [!Important]
> Netdata package updates may replace `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf`. You must re-copy/overwrite `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` from this repository after each Netdata update until a permanent fix is available. I am working on a fix to make this persistent — in the meantime, reapply the config after updates.

Optional: reapply script
You can use a small script to reapply the config quickly:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
REPO_CONF="/path/to/repo/netdata.conf"
TARGET_CONF="/etc/netdata/netdata.conf"

if [ ! -f "$REPO_CONF" ]; then
  echo "Source config not found: $REPO_CONF"
  exit 1
fi

sudo cp "$REPO_CONF" "$TARGET_CONF"
sudo chown root:root "$TARGET_CONF"
sudo systemctl restart netdata
echo "netdata.conf applied and netdata restarted"
```
Make the script executable (e.g. `chmod +x apply-netdata-conf.sh`) and run it after TrueNAS updates.

Working on a fix — PRs welcome
I’m actively working on a solution that avoids manual re-copying on updates. Contributions, suggestions, or a persistent TrueNAS-compatible Netdata configuration method are welcome — please open a PR.

### graphite_exporter

You obviously need a running `graphite_exporter` which is scrabed by your prometheus instance and is reachable by your TrueNAS instance to push metrics to.

### Running exporter inside truenas

Check [TRUENAS.md](TRUENAS.md) to see options to use this exporter directly inside of TrueNAS.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To utilise the provided `graphite_mapping.conf` replace your existing conf of your `graphite_exporter` and restart it. For the grafana dashboards you can simply import the provided `json` file.

<!-- EXPOSED METRICS -->
## Exposed metrics

> [!WARNING]
> Outdated will be updated soon

See [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) for the exposed metrics by this config.

<!-- DASHBOARDS -->
## Dashboards

> [!WARNING]
> Outdated will be updated soon

The dasboards are located inside the `dashboards` folder and are simple json files which can be imported into grafana und used with the metrics.
